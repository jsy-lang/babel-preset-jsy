# babel-preset-jsy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-preset-jsy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-preset-jsy)

JSY is an indented (offside) JavaScript dialect. We believe indentation is better at describing code blocks.

This is the Babel 6.x preset for offside-based JavasCript syntax building on [babel-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-env)

Please see [JSY language docs](https://github.com/jsy-lang/jsy-lang-docs) for details on the JSY dialect.


## Use

```json
{"babel": {
  "preset": ["jsy/lean"]
}}
```
